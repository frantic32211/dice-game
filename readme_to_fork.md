# How to fork a repository
 ---
 
To Fork any repo means to make a copy of the repo to our profile.
 
In order to fork any repository, we need to first go to the desired github page/repo webpage.

There we can see the **"Fork"** button as shown below:

Now, we need to click on the Fork button. 

As soon as we click, the particular repo will be copied to our profile.

And the name highlighted before the repo will be changed to our profile name.
